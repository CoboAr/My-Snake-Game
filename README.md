# My-Snake-Game
An implementation of Snake game using turtle python library.

## How does it work?
When main.py is run, a screen 600x600px will show up with a snake, current score, highest score, and a food cell at a random position into the screen. The snake has 1 head cell and 2 body cells. The snake starts moving on the right direction and can be controlled with arrow keyes: When "Up" arrow key is pressed the snake will turn up, When "Down" arrow key is pressed the snake will turn down, When "Left" arrow key is pressed the snake will turn left, and when "Right" arrow key is pressed the snake will turn right. When the head cell collides with a food cell, the food cell will turn into a body cell and a new food cell will appear in random position into the screen. If the snake collides with its body or with the screen's borders, the current score will be saved into the highest score and a new game will start automatically. The player can stop the game at any moment by pressing "Escape" key.
